# Encryption & Decryption Application
A robust encryption and decryption application implementing multiple classical and modern cryptographic algorithms with advanced cryptanalysis tools.

## üîê Features

### Implemented Ciphers
- **Hill Cipher**: Matrix-based encryption technique
- **Caesar Cipher**: Classic substitution cipher with fixed shift
- **Vigen√®re Cipher**: Polyalphabetic substitution using a keyword
- **ROT13**: Special case of Caesar cipher with 13-position shift
- **Affine Cipher**: Mathematical function-based substitution cipher
- **XOR Cipher**: Bitwise operation-based encryption
- **RSA**: Public-key cryptography implementation

### Cryptanalysis Tools
- **Letter Frequency Analysis**: Statistical tool to analyze character distribution in ciphertext
- **Kasiski Examination**: Technique for finding the key length in polyalphabetic substitution ciphers
- **Index of Coincidence**: Mathematical tool to measure the unevenness of letter distribution in a text

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [List your prerequisites here]
- [Any specific versions needed]

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chakibceran22/passowrd-manager-app.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd passowrd-manager-app
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install  # or your specific install command
```

## üíª Usage

### RSA Key Configuration
You can modify the RSA keys in the `encModules` file located in the frontend directory. Adjust the keys according to your security requirements.

### Cipher Implementations
All cipher implementations can be found and tested in the `encModules` folder. Each cipher has its own dedicated file for easy maintenance and testing.

### Using Analysis Tools
The cryptanalysis tools are available in the `analysisTools` directory:

- **Letter Frequency Analysis**: Helps break simple substitution ciphers by comparing character frequencies with known language patterns
```javascript
import { letterFrequencyAnalyzer } from './analysisTools/letterFrequency';
const analysis = letterFrequencyAnalyzer(ciphertext);
```

- **Kasiski Examination**: Identifies repeated sequences in ciphertext to determine potential key lengths
```javascript
import { kaskiskiExamination } from './analysisTools/kasiski';
const potentialKeyLengths = kaskiskiExamination(ciphertext);
```

- **Index of Coincidence**: Measures randomness in text to distinguish between monoalphabetic and polyalphabetic ciphers
```javascript
import { calculateIC } from './analysisTools/indexOfCoincidence';
const ic = calculateIC(ciphertext);
```
