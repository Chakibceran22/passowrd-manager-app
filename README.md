# Encryption & Decryption Application

A robust encryption and decryption application implementing multiple classical and modern cryptographic algorithms.

## 🔐 Features

### Implemented Ciphers
- **Hill Cipher**: Matrix-based encryption technique
- **Caesar Cipher**: Classic substitution cipher with fixed shift
- **Vigenère Cipher**: Polyalphabetic substitution using a keyword
- **ROT13**: Special case of Caesar cipher with 13-position shift
- **Affine Cipher**: Mathematical function-based substitution cipher
- **XOR Cipher**: Bitwise operation-based encryption
- **RSA**: Public-key cryptography implementation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [List your prerequisites here]
- [Any specific versions needed]

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chakibceran22/passowrd-manager-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd passowrd-manager-app
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install  # or your specific install command
```

## 💻 Usage

### RSA Key Configuration
You can modify the RSA keys in the `encModules` file located in the frontend directory. Adjust the keys according to your security requirements.

### Cipher Implementations
All cipher implementations can be found and tested in the `encModules` folder. Each cipher has its own dedicated file for easy maintenance and testing.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Future Features
- [ ] MD5 Hashing
- [ ] SHA-256 Implementation
- [ ] Bcrypt Integration
- [ ] Additional Hash Functions

## 🔍 Testing

Each cipher implementation includes its own test suite. To run tests:
```bash
npm test  # or your specific test command
```

## 📚 Documentation

Detailed documentation for each cipher implementation can be found in their respective files within the `encModules` directory.

## ⚠️ Security Notice

While this application implements various encryption algorithms, some (like Caesar Cipher) are for educational purposes and should not be used for securing sensitive data in production environments.
